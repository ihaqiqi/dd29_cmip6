# Global Corn Heat Stress: Mean and SD of Degree Days Above 29°C based on NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 Climate Projections
## Description
These scripts are used to estimate the mean and standard deviation (SD) of corn heat stress (degree days above 29°C) for around 20 climate models in NEX-GDDP-CMIP6.
A full description of methods, including growing season, daily temperature distribution, and statistical coefficients, can be found at Haqiqi, I. (2024). Trade can buffer climate-induced risks and volatilities in crop supply. Environmental Research: Food Systems. https://doi.org/10.1088/2976-601X/ad7d12
